Introduction
1.1	Introduction to Proposed System

“Shiv Chhatrapati College” 
It is a website we’ve made using HTML and CSS language.
On the website, there is a header picture imported from the original website, below which is set of buttons, where,
    • Home : redirects to the same webpage of project you are on.
    • Message : It redirects to official college website’s message page.
    • Course : It is redirects to B.Sc Computer Science course’sc webpage of original website.
    • Gallery : It redirects to Gallery of college’s website to show pictures taken by college.
    • ERP Login : It is original webpage of Marathwada  Shikshan Prasarak Mandal ‘s student login page.
    • Contact Us : It is feedback page with our (i.e. student’s) name, contact information such as phone number and email address. On this page you can submit your name and your feedback for us. Note : Submitting feedback doesn’t send us anything to know, but for assurance to viewer, it just redirects to submit.html and then shows option to be redirected to p1.html or feedback.html.
Additionally, on feedback page, our e-mail address moves from right to left and if the viewer hovers over our name, they’ll see our phone number. 

If you notice on homepage, you will see our name, sliding from right to left as well.








1.2	Introduction to Technology Used 
We’ve used HTML and CSS language in our project implemented in Visual Studio Code.
HTML:  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within the tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. 
CSS:  Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colors, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
Visual Studio Code:  Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment(IDE) developed by Microsoft to develop GUI(Graphical User Interface), console, Web applications, web apps, mobile apps, cloud, and web services, etc. With the help of this IDE, you can create managed code as well as native code. It uses the various platforms of Microsoft software development software like Windows store, Microsoft Silverlight, and Windows API, etc. It is not a language-specific IDE as you can use this to write code in C#, C++, VB(Visual Basic), Python, JavaScript, and many more languages. It provides support for 36 different programming languages. It is available for Windows as well as for macOS.






 







Requirement Analysis

Hardware Requirement

For an advanced level of web development that uses Java, JavaScript, Python, etc., you will need a certain bare minimum to have smooth operations. For minimum requirements should include:
    • AMD Ryzen processor or Intel Core i5 (8th generation)
    • 8 GB RAM (DDR4)
    • 256 SSD
    • Intel HD 610 (GT1)
    • Screen resolution of 1366 X 768 pixels.
Recommended  specifications for robust performance:
    • Intel Core i5/i7 (10th generation) or AMD Ryzen 3 processors and above.
    • 16 GB RAM or more.
    • 512 GB SSD and above.
    • AMD Radeon or Nvidia GeForce GTX graphics card
    • Screen resolution of 1920 X 1080 pixels.


Software Requirement
Text Editor : You can write HTML in a plain text editor such as Notepad in Windows 10, TextEdit and Sublime Text on a Mac, or Vi or Emacs in Linux. You create the HTML coding for the page, save the document as a web file, and open it in a browser to make sure it looks like it is supposed to. 
Komodo IDE and its user-friendly interface are suitable for both beginning and advanced web developers. Komodo IDE's autocomplete feature is particularly handy when you're writing code for common elements such as links. The software supports color coding of different coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and many others. Komodo IDE runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
 CoffeeCup HTML Editor is especially useful for new developers who are more interested in learning to code than in a visual interface. This robust editor comes with templates and has validation checkers to help keep your code free of errors. It includes code completion and supports other coding languages you might use in conjunction with HTML. The software highlights errors, explains why they appeared, and tells you how to fix them. CoffeeCup HTML Editor runs on Windows.
